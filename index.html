			<h2>About Rob</h2>
			<img id="rob-pic" src="assets/images/pic.jpg" alt="Rob McCracken">
			<p>My name is Rob McCracken and I am a local product of Richmond, Virginia.  I was born in Henrico where I obtained my primary and seconday education. I also have an AS in Computer Science from ECPI.</p>

			<p>I am currently a manager for Verizon Wireless in Midlothian, VA where I have been since May 2016. I have worked at many of our retail locations from Woodbridge, VA to South Boston, VA. My carreer started with Verizon Wireless right out of college where I started out as a Retail Sales Consultant.</p>

			<p>In October of this year I married the love of my life Emily (now McCracken).  She and I concider ourselves foodies and try to go to a new restaurant every chance we get. Since we enjoy food and craft cocktails so much we also make our way to the gym at least three times a week. </p>
